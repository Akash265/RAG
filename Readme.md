# RAG Implementation with RLHF
### This project implements a question-answering system using a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. 
#### The system allows users to upload multiple documents, ask questions, and receive answers with highlighted text from the documents.
